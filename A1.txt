1.Various Sources of Big data:
   1.Banking sectors
   2.Transportation Services
   3.Social media
   4 Sensor Data
   5.Online Shopping


2.3 V's of Big Data:
       
         1.Volume
         2.Variety
         3.Velocity
 Volume :
         Volume defines the amount of data stored.This is used to determine whether it is to be considered as bigdata or not.
 Variety:
         Variety defines the type of the data and also nature of the data.
 Velocity:
         Velocity defines the speed of data processing for meeting all the demands and challenges.

3.Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling:
  
   Horizontal scaling:

        1. Horizontal scaling means adding more nodes to system.
        2. It is also referred as "Scale-out".

   Vertical Scaling :
        
        1. Vertical Scaling means adding resources to a single node in a system.
        2. It is also referred as "Scale-up".

4.Need and Working of Hadoop:
   
   Need of Hadoop:

        1.Mostly hadoop is needed for storing  different types of data and also for processing large amount of data.
        2.It have highly scalable storage platform.
        3.Hadoop is fault tolerance.

   Working of Hadoop :
        1.The Working of Hadoop is processing an unstructured data into structured data. 
        2.In hadoop there are two data processing frameworks.They are
             
                        * HDFs
                        * Map reduce
   
       3.HDFS is used to read a file from a distributed system and then Map redue is used for scheduling and processing the data.
